# My flask app

##flask RESTful apis 

My flask playground. Here, I test my knowledge of flask and RESTful apis in python before working on my sentiment app which is still a work in progress (a lot of work :) ) 

This app is built with Flask, Flask-RESTful, Flask-JWT and Flask-SQLAlchemy

Deployed on Heroku.
